# Wireframing

## WHat is Wireframing?

* Wireframing allows a designer to define and plan the heirarchy of information for their website, app, or product. A good example would be when you are writing a paper for school. You would gather information through research and then create an outline on how you wanted to lay that information out.

* Done in black and white, allows you to see how a user interacts with a site without all the graphics and color. The user should easily be able to navigate the site without all the fluff.

* Wireframing can be done on a whiteboard so everyone can see and make changes or offer ideas or you can start with pencil and paper. Sketch your ideas then move on to a whiteboard. There is also software to use that allows you to digitally design your site and most offer collaboration as well.

## Steps to take to create a wireframe

1. **Research:** You want to know your audience and what the site is geared to do. You would gather your information through online surveys, individual interviews, user groups, and usability testing. You also want to know the business requirements.

2. **Have a reference sheet:** Create a cheatsheet of all the information you have collected along with your business goals and user goals.

3. **Map it out:** Have an idea of how many screens you'll have on your site and the flow for your users. Should flow smooth like when you read a book.

4. **Sketch it out:** Time to begin the wireframing. This is just an outline or idea of the layout. Doesn't include the fine details.

5. **Details:** Once you have your wireframes, and collaborated with your colleagues, its time to add the details to flow naturally. Now you are ready for users to test it out.

6. **Prototypes:** Once you have your user feedback, you begin on the realistic wireframing. This is what the site will actually look like.

The key to a good wireframe is clarity,confidence and simplicity.
