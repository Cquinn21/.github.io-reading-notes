# Text Editor vs IDE

### Text Editor
A text editor is software that allows you to write and manage text that is used to build a website. 

#### Features to look for in Text Editors:
1. **Code Completion**
  - Code completion is similar to predictive text on a smartphone. As you begin to type, the text editor will offer suggestions based on what has been typed.

2. **Syntax Highlighting**
  - Syntax Highlighting highlights your text different colors. Attributes will be different color than the element and copy. This makes the text easier to read and to find mistakes.

3. **Themes**
  - Themes allows you to change the appearance of the editor. Finding one that is easy on the eyes to reduce eye strain and fatigue is the best. 

4. **Extensions**
  - Extensions give your code more functionality and features.

### IDE
* IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. IDE's combine different software programs into one single system. IDE allows you to text edit, manage files, it has a compiler, and a debugger. Microsoft Visual Studios is an example of an IDE software. 
 
### Command Line Interface
* Command line Interface is a program on computers known as terminal on MacOS and command prompt on Windows. It allows you to created & delete files, run programs, and navigate through folders and files on your system. 
* There is a **shell** which tells the terminal how to behave. (bash is the shell) 
* The first thing you type is the command, then the argument. (must separate by spaces)
* There are **Absolute and Relative Paths** 
* Absolute Path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the root directory. It will always begin with a forward slash ( / ). Example: ls /home/jj/Documents
* Relative Path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to what you currently are in the system. They will **_not_** have a slash at the beginning. Example: ls Documents
* Has Tab Completion. If you are typing something you can hit the **Tab** key and it will complete the text for you unless there are multiple options. If there are multiple options simply hit **Tab** it will give you your options. 
* Must be aware of case sensitivity.

### Commands
* **pwd** Print working Directory: will print the full system path of the current working directory to standard output.
*  **ls** Short for list: lists files or directories
*  **ls -a** lists the contents of the directory and any hidden files in that directory
*  **cd** changes the directory that you are in. 
*  **mkdir** creates a new directory. 
*  **file** to find out what type of file such as .png .txt

These are just a few commands to use in the terminal and there are many more. Along with different paths.
