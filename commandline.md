# Text Editor vs IDE

### Text Editor
A text editor is software that allows you to write,and manage text that is used to build a website. 

#### Features to look for in Text Editors:
1. Code Completetion
  - Code completion is similar to predictive text on a smartphone. As you begin to type, the text editor will offer suggestions based on what has been typed.

2. Syntax Hightlighting
  - Synax Highlighting highlights your text different colors. Attributes will be different color than the element and copy. This makes the text easier to read and to find mistakes.

3. Themes
  - Themes allows you to change the appearance of the editor. Finding one that is easy on the eyes to reduce eye strain and fatigue is the best. 

4. Extensions
  - Extesnions give your code more functionality and features.

### IDE
* IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. IDE's combine different software programs into one single system. IDE allows you to text edit, manage files, it has a compiler, and a debugger. Microsoft Visual Studios is an example of an IDE software. 
 
### Command Line Interface
* Command line Interface is a program on computers known as terminal on MacOS and command prompt on Windows. It allows you to created & delete files, run programs, and navigate through folders and files on your system. 
* There is a **shell** which tells the terminal how to behave. (bash is the shell) 
* The first thing you type is the command, then the argument. (must separate by spaces)
* There are **Absolute and Relative Paths** 
* Absolute Path specifies the location of a file or directory in relation to the root directory. It will always begin with a (\) forward slash. Example: ```ls /home/jj/Documents```
