# Text Editor vs IDE

### Text Editor
A text editor is software that allows you to write,and manage text that is used to build a website. 

#### Features to look for in Text Editors:
1. <u>Code Completetion</u>
  - Code completion is similar to predictive text on a smartphone. As you begin to type, the text editor will offer suggestions based on what has been typed.

2. <u>Syntax Hightlighting</u>
  - Synax Highlighting highlights your text different colors. Attributes will be different color than the element and copy. This makes the text easier to read and to find mistakes.

3. <u>Themes</u>
  - Themes allows you to change the appearance of the editor. Finding one that is easy on the eyes to reduce eye strain and fatigue is the best. 

4. <u>Extensions</u>
  - Extesnions give your code more functionality and features.

### IDE
* IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. IDE's combine different software programs into one single system. IDE allows you to text edit, manage files, it has a compiler, and a debugger. Microsoft Visual Studios is an example of an IDE software.
