# JavaScript

* JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It's lightweight and used as part of webpages allowing users to interact with dynamic pages.

* Has object-oriented capabilities. Allows for software to be designed around the object or the data, rather than login and functions. (what you can manipulate vs logic behind the manipulation).

* Mostly used in webpages but also used in Node.js and other softwares.

## JavaScript Variables

3 Ways to declare JavaScript variables:

1. var

2. let

3. const

* Variables are containers for storing data or values.

*Example:* ```var x = 5```

* *var* is the **declaration**

* *x* is the **variable**

* *5* is the **value**

## Identifiers

* Variables must be *identified* with unique names called **identifiers**.

Rules for creating identifiers:

* Names can have letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

* Must begin with a letter can also begin with a ```$``` and ```_```.

* Are case sensitive.

* Reserved words cannot be used. This would be JavaScript Keywords.

## Assigned Operator

* ```(=)``` is an assignment operator it does not mean equal to. *Example:* ```x = x + 5``` assigns x to x + 5. **_Note_** equal to uses ```(==)```.

## Data Types

* Variables can hold numbers and text.

* Text is called strings. They are written in double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. Placing numbers in quotes will treat them as a text string. 

## Declaring Variables

* Creating a variable is called *declaring*.

* Declare using **var** keyword.

* Variable has no value after declaration until you assign a value. Use the ```(=)``` sign to assign a value. *Example:* ```name = "Chris";```

* This can also be done when you declare it. *Example:* ```var name = "Chris";```

* Declare all variables at the beginning of script.

* Several variables can be declared in one statement using a comma to separate them. *Example:* ```var name = "Chris", carMake = "BMW", price = 250;``` *_Note_* Can also use multiple lines. 

* Can do arithmetic *Example:* ```var x = 2 + 3 + 4;```

* Add strings ```var x = "John" + "" + "Doe";``` the will be concatenated.

* Using the dollar sign is commonly used as an alias for the main function. *Example:* using jQuery the ```$``` selects HTML elements ```$("p")``` means to select all *p* elements.

* Underscores ```(_)``` is usually used for private or hidden variables.
