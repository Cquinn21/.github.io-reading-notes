## ***GROWTH MINDSET***
A Growth Mindset is taking your failures, reexamining them then growing from them. To change your perspective and view those challenges we face as a means for growth and to make us stronger instead of giving up. You help in the success of others rather than being defeated and jealous. You put in the hard work and really give it your all. All you can do is the best you can do. Failure only occurs when you quit trying.

## ***Reminders for a Growth Mindset:***
1. I will strive for progress, not for perfection.
2. I haven't figured it out **YET**! 
3. Mistakes creates growth. It is how I learn and get better.
